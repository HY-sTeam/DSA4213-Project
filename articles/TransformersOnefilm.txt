Following the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Paramount Pictures tasked Akiva Goldsman, who would later serve as a co-story writer for Transformers: The Last Knight (2017), in March 2015 to work with the film franchise's director, Michael Bay, executive producer, Steven Spielberg, and producer, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, in setting up a "writer's room" to create ideas for potential future Transformers films and spinoff films. After setting up the writer's room, multiple writers were hired to write future installments in the franchise. According to Goldsman, the team would look at various Transformers media created by Hasbro for inspiration; if they found one that interested them, they could submit a treatment, which would then be further developed by the whole team. In late May, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari had joined the writer's room. According to Deadline Hollywood, one of the ideas that came from the writer's room had the working title of Transformers One, and would serve as an animated prequel focusing on the Autobotâ€“Decepticon conflict that began on Cybertron.In August 2017, it was reported that an animated Transformers film was officially in the works. Following the release of Bumblebee (2018), di Bonaventura discussed the animated film, clarifying that it was "in the works" and would "tell the whole Cybertron mythology", assuring that fans of the franchise would enjoy the film; Bumblebee director Travis Knight additionally expressed interest in the film.In April 2020, it was reported that Josh Cooley had been hired to direct the film and was overseeing the script by Barrer and Ferrari.
