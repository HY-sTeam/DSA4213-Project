This article shows the complete fictional and non-fictional friends and family of Barbie, a fashion doll manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and launched on 9 March 1959.


== Main characters ==
Barbara Millicent "Barbie" Roberts (1959–present): A blonde-haired, blue-eyed doll who was born in the fictional town of Willows, Wisconsin. According to eponymous Random House books published in the 1960s, the character's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. Barbie's age has fluctuated; she was originally a 19-year-old, but she is often shown as an older character in adult careers. The inaugural episode of Life in the Dreamhouse even jokes that she is over 43 years old. Barbie has three younger sisters: Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea. Mattel describes Barbie as strong, confident and always willing to help her siblings.
Kenneth Sean "Ken" Carson (1961–1967, 1969–present): Barbie's male counterpart and former boyfriend as well as the second character added to the line. Mattel announced a split between him and Barbie in 2004 and a reunion on Valentine's Day in 2011. According to books published by Random House in the 1960s, Ken's full name is Kenneth Sean Carson. Since Barbie: Dolphin Magic, he is one of Barbie's best friends and next-door neighbor, although pre-2017 romantic aesthetic began to resurface between the two in the 2023 television series, Barbie: A Touch of Magic.


== Family members ==


=== Barbie's sisters ===
Barbie has three young sisters: Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea, who made their collective debuts in the 2011 Christmas film, Barbie: A Perfect Christmas. Chelsea, previously known as Kelly, had a lead role in the 2002 syndicated television series, Kelly Dream Club, in which Barbie appeared in a supporting role. Since then, they appeared as main characters in media adaptations of the franchise, including Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and the Barbie & Her Sisters in... film entries in the film series. Since Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures in 2018, they have become permanent main characters in the overall Barbie franchise makeup.

Skipper Roberts (1964–2003, 2009–present): The teenage younger sister of Barbie and the first character added to Barbie's family. Originally released as an 8-year-old, she was changed to a 14-year-old later on. Mattel temporarily halted production of Skipper dolls between 2003 and 2009. When Skipper returned in 2009, she was redesigned to have brown hair with a purple (or sometimes blue) colored streak. Since the debut of Life in the Dreamhouse in 2012, Skipper has shown interest in technology, music and gadgets. Skipper had a lead role in the 2023 television film, Barbie: Skipper and the Big Babysitting Adventure.
Stacie Roberts (1990–present): Originally introduced as Kelly in the 1990 Wedding Day Midge gift set as the flower girl, this doll was renamed and re-introduced as Stacie shortly thereafter in 1992, and the Kelly name was instead used for her younger sister. Since her appearance in Life in the Dreamhouse, Stacie is 11 years old and shown to be a competitive, skilled athlete. She has her own line of sports-themed dolls called "Team Stacie".
Shelly/Kelly/Chelsea Roberts (1995–2010 as Shelly/Kelly, 2011–present as Chelsea): Barbie's youngest sister, approximately 6 years old, then later 7 years old. Since her name changed to Chelsea, she loves the color pink and has blonde hair and blue eyes like her older sister Barbie. Also, she is shown to be mutely arrogant in showing cleverness and brilliance at solving certain mysteries. Chelsea is the star of her own show format, Barbie: Dreamtopia and the 2021 television film, Barbie & Chelsea: The Lost Birthday.


=== Barbie's parents ===
George Roberts (1960–present): George is the father of Barbie and Skipper and the husband of Margaret. Originally just a book character, he had never been issued in doll form until 2018 due to his debut animation appearance in Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures. Originally an engineer in the 1960s Barbie book series, but his job or occupancy was retooled as a documentary filmmaker since Dreamhouse Adventures.
Margaret Rawlins Roberts (1960–present): Margaret is the mother of Barbie, Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea and the wife of George. Like George and also originally a book character, she had never been issued in doll form until 2018 due to her debut appearance in Dreamhouse Adventures. Initially a homemaker, her job or occupancy was retooled as a computer engineer on debut and the designer of the Roberts family dreamhouse since Dreamhouse Adventures. She has a sister named Millicent.


=== Discontinued characters ===
Tutti and Todd (Tutti: 1965–1971, Todd: 1965–1996): Twins, both Tutti and Todd were younger siblings of Barbie and Skipper and had seamless 'bendy' bodies with internal wires. The two were only sold together in one set. They debuted in 1966 and were available in the US until 1971, remaining on the European market until 1980. Todd was reintroduced in 1991 as part of the wedding party for Barbie's best friend Midge Hadley, but Tutti was not reintroduced, with new sisters Kelly and Stacie taking her place. Mattel produced several more of the new Todd dolls over the next few years, but Todd was dropped from the Barbie line after 2008. The last version of Todd was the 2008 Todd and Stacie Mary Poppins boxed set, with a comment on the back that "Todd and Stacie are dressed as Michael and Jane from Disney's Mary Poppins".
Francie Fairchild (1966–1977): Marketed as "Barbie's Modern Cousin," Francie paved the way for Barbie's transition into the MOD era. Francie appeared to be only slightly younger than Barbie, and had a straight, streamlined figure. The Francie doll was the first to feature rooted eyelashes. In the March 1966 issue of Barbie Magazine, she is the daughter of Claude and Lily Fairchild.
Jazzie (1988–1992): Another cousin of Barbie and part of a small group of high school age dolls. She was taller than Francie, with Jazzie being almost the same height as Barbie.
Kristine "Krissy" Roberts (1998–2001): This character is an infant and is only intermittently included in the Barbie sibling lineup.
Blaine Gordon (2004): Barbie's Australian ex-boyfriend, whom she dated during her much-publicized "breakup" with Ken. Blaine is said to be the brother of Summer, one of Barbie's friends. Blaine does not show up in any of the Barbie series but was originally a character from Generation Girls and showed interest in Ana.


=== Extended family members ===
Millicent Rawlins (2010): Barbie's aunt and Margaret's sister. Although never made into a doll, she first appeared media-wise as a fashion designer with an atelier in Paris in the 2010 film Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. She also appeared towards the conclusion of the 2011 film, Barbie: A Perfect Christmas where she joined with Barbie and her sisters in celebrating the holiday. She has yet to appear in any form since 2012.
Grandmother Rawlins (2015): Barbie's grandmother and Margaret Roberts' mother. She passed her love of reading onto Barbie and gave her a book that Barbie related to. She is encouraging and supportive of her granddaughter. Her first movie appearance is in Barbie and the Secret Door as Alexa's (Barbie) grandmother. She also appears in Barbie & Her Sisters in The Great Puppy Adventure as herself. She was first mentioned in the 1962 Random House Novel Here's Barbie where she is implied to be living in New Orleans. She was never made into a doll.
Kristen Rawlins (2013): A cousin of Barbie, appearing in the picture book, The Wedding Party. She was never made into a doll.
Marlene Roberts (2015): Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. She was never made into a doll.
Max and Marie Roberts (2013): The twin children of Marlene Roberts, cousins of Barbie and her siblings, and niece and nephew of Margaret Roberts and George Roberts. They showed up in Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale. Marie is shown to be an otaku.
Lillian Roberts Fairchild (1966): Francie's mother, Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. She was never made into a doll.
Claude Fairchild (1966): Francie's father, Barbie's uncle and Margaret and George's brother-in-law. He was never made into a doll.
Adele (2019–Present): Barbie's aunt and the owner of the Windy Willows Inn in Barbie's hometown, Willows, Wisconsin. She first appeared in season 3, episode 3 of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, "The Ballad of Windy Willows." Her most recent appearance was in season 5, episode 7, "The Curse of the Miner's Ghost." Her design is very similar to Margaret's, suggesting they are sisters. She was never made into a doll.


== Barbie's friends ==


=== Female best friends ===
Margaret "Midge" Hadley Sherwood (1963–1966, 1988–2004, 2013–2015): This character was Barbie's Irish American best friend. She was the third character introduced to the Barbie line, following Barbie and Ken. In the Random House novels, her last name is Hadley. She was paired with Allan Sherwood, Ken's best friend, when Allan was introduced in 1964. After she married Allan/Alan in 1991, she became Midge Hadley Sherwood. In the 1990s Price Stern Sloan series Adventures with Barbie, she and Alan are married, and in book 5, "The Phantom of Shrinking Pond", by Suzanne Weyn, (1992), it's implied that she is named after her Aunt Margaret.  She is named Viky in Brazil (from the book "Barbie Doll Around the World", by J. Michael Augustyniak, (2008, Collector Books). In 2001 she was given her own line named Happy Family. Midge was released with a magnetic belly and a baby. Also in the line was Alan and their son Ryan, and Midge's parents though they were never given real names. In 2013, she was brought back in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse web series where she undergoes a makeover to look more modern, though the character tends to act like she is still in the 1960s. There is no mention of Allan/Alan in the series.
Christie (1968–2005, 2015): Barbie doll's first African American friend character, Christie was part of the new group of Talking dolls for 1968. She was later issued as a Twist 'N Turn version. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, though the original Christie face sculpt was discontinued in 1978. She is notable in that she has been romantically linked with several male characters over the years. In 1970, she was linked with Brad, the Talking Brad doll even said, "Christie is the greatest". In 1982, the Sunsational Malibu Christie doll had a boyfriend named Ken who used the Brad face sculpt with rooted hair. In the late 80s, Christie was paired with Steven. The surname O'Neil is associated with the Nikki character, who is purported to be Christie's sister, but the surname has not been associated directly with Christie. The doll has been criticized as following American beauty standards instead of representing African cultural body image, representing only one tone of skin color, and because her sculpted features were seen to symbolize white standards of beauty. Christie was discontinued when Barbie got Nikki as her new African American friend, though Nikki uses Christie's face, the change in name of almost the same doll was never stated. In the 2015 movie Barbie and her Sister in a Puppy Rescue, Christie is the name of one of Barbie's old friends from Willows, Wisconsin. On the back of the 1998 Beyond Pink Christie box, her birthday is August 9.
Teresa Rivera (1988–present): Originally used the 1983 Spanish Barbie face sculpt for the Island Fun Teresa doll and the Beach Blast Teresa doll. Starting with the Wet 'N Wild Teresa doll, the character began using the 1972 Steffie face sculpt. Beginning with the Rollerblade Teresa doll, the character began using an all-new face sculpt that has become known as the Teresa face sculpt. In the Grolier book "High Sea Adventure" (1999), her last name is Rivera. Teresa is of Hispanic heritage. She is named Debora in Brazil (from the book Barbie Doll Around the World, by J. Michael Augustyniak, (2008, Collector Books). She was featured in the 2008 film as Barbie's best friend, where she told a story about her and Barbie (as Liana and Alexa) as two girls closer than most friends living in the forest. She appeared in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends. She also starred in the 2016 movie, Barbie: Spy Squad alongside Barbie and Renee. On the back of the 1999 Beyond Pink Teresa box, her birthday is October 2.
Summer Gordon (2004–2015): This doll used an all-new face sculpt. Summer is Blaine's little sister with strawberry blonde hair and green/brown eyes. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She was originally from Australia when she was first introduced in 2004, but in all cartoons she's American.
Nicole "Nikki" Watkins (2006–present): This doll appears as one of Barbie's current friends, and is closer to her, Barbie is often seen hanging out with just Teresa and Nikki. She has used multiple different head sculpts through the years. Her last name is O'Neil in the 2010 Random House book, "Barbie: I Can be a Movie Star," but her last name was established as Watkins in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends.
Raquelle (2006–2015): This doll used the Summer face sculpt with her original debut. In 2011, she appeared with an all-new face sculpt in the Barbie Fashionistas line. She is Barbie's frenemy as shown in The Barbie Diaries, Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale, Barbie: A Fairy Secret and the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, and has a twin brother named Ryan.
Grace (2009–2015): This African American doll made its first appearance in the 2009 SIS Line, she used to be a friend of Barbie who moves to Chicago and makes new friends. She also appears in Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. In 2014, she moved back to Malibu. Her backstory was rebooted when she started appearing in Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She is very smart and interested in science.


=== Other friends ===
Stacey (1968–1971): Introduced as "Barbie's British chum" during the musical British Invasion of the US, Stacey first appeared with long hair, either blonde, brunette, or redhead, tied in a side ponytail. A second edition had much shorter hair, styled in a curly flip. It is the Stacey face sculpt that is used for Malibu Barbie.
PJ (1969–1983): Fully representing the "groovy", "hippie" era of the late 1960s, PJ originally appeared using Midge's face sculpt, but with much longer hair, tied into beaded pigtails. In 1972, with PJ's addition to the Malibu Barbie line (consisting of Barbie, Ken, Skipper, and Francie), she changed to the Steffie face sculpt, which continued until the end of her production. She was billed as Barbie's best friend, again replacing Midge. One of the final iterations of the doll, "Dream Date PJ", erroneously lists her as Barbie's cousin. It is the only such reference and should not be considered canon.
Steffie (1972): Although only three versions of Steffie were produced, all of which appeared in 1972, her face sculpt was used for several Barbie-family dolls for decades after, primarily the PJ doll. Some Barbies of that era, issued outside the US, use the Steffie face sculpt. In at least one Mattel advertisement from 1972, Busy Steffie is pictured, but is referred to as "Busy PJ", indicating that, even though Barbie fans refer to her as having the Steffie face sculpt, it is actually Steffie that has the PJ face sculpt. However, because PJ had used the Midge face sculpt for three years prior, Steffie was the first Mattel doll to use it as her only face sculpt, hence the name "Steffie face".
Cara (1975-1976): Appears in the Mattel Barbie line with her boyfriend Curtis, alongside Barbie's other African American couple, Brad and Christie. Cara was produced as Free Moving Cara, Ballerina Cara, and both Quick Curl and Deluxe Quick Curl Cara. She was produced with the Steffie face (Christie continues to appear as well, in the Malibu, Fashion Photo and Superstar lines from Mattel).
Whitney (1986-1991): Described on her debut as “Barbie doll’s glamorous best friend” in the Jewel Secrets Barbie line of 1986 (Princess Laura in Europe). This doll uses the Steffie face and always featured brunette hair. Returned in 1987 as Nurse Whitney in the Doctor Barbie line, and Perfume Pretty Whitney the same year. Made a return for 1988 in the Style Magic Barbie line. She made her last appearance as European exclusive Ultra Hair Whitney.
Kira/Miko (Marina in Europe) (1985–2001): Barbie doll's first Asian friend character, the first appearance was in the line of Tropical Barbie in 1985 as Miko, a native Hawaiian. Kira, an Asian-American, was later introduced looking similar to Miko and with the same head sculpt. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, the original Kira/Oriental face sculpt was created in 1980.
Becky (1997-1999): A friend of Barbie who uses a wheelchair. She used the Teen Skipper head mold but there were only three dolls ever made. She only appeared in Detective Barbie series and Secret Agent Barbie and voiced by Kath Soucie.
Kayla and Lea (2000-2006): First appearing as Dress up Kayla, she appears in multiple formats for the next four years and was released in tandem with Lea. Lea was an Asian girl and Kayla was depicted as almost every race, not being consistent. Kayla eventually was cut, and Lea existed until 2006, leaving Mattel's Barbie line with no Asian dolls until Lea's reintroduction in 2014.

Chris (1967–68, 1976–77): A female character doll, with a different face sculpt from Tutti and Todd.
Carla (European release only, 1976): An African American character doll.


=== Francie's friends ===
Casey (1967–70, 1975): Billed as Francie's Fun Friend, she is the same measurements as Francie, and is thus able to wear her wardrobe. She has blue eyes, and is found in blonde, brunette and redhead styles (the redhead possibly being a result of the brunette hair oxidizing, as happens with Christie dolls). Her original blonde hair is a true blonde, cut into a chin-length bob. Later editions feature a platinum blonde Casey with a coarser hair texture. Casey's hair is frequently asymmetrical, as was in vogue at the time. These dolls' hair is longer, sometimes near shoulder length. All editions come without shoes, with Casey in a one-piece swimsuit: the top is white with gold mesh; the bottoms are shiny gold (though frequently fade to a matte silver color). She comes with only one ear pierced, in which is placed one gold-tone dangle triangle earring, which turns Casey's ear green if left in for a number of years. Dolls found by collectors today frequently present with some or extensive 'green ear'. The sooner the earring was removed, the better the chance this situation is avoided entirely.       •In 1971, Mattel launched its iconic Malibu line of dolls. Even though Francie is featured prominently, it is with Casey's head mould and blue eyes (Francie is brown-eyed).        •In 1975, Mattel produced a budget Francie and Casey, contained in clear plastic bags with hang tags, referred to by collectors as 'baggie Francie' and 'baggie Casey'. Interestingly, both Francie and Casey share Francie's head mold. For these pink skin-toned, straight leg and straight waist dolls, Francie is a brunette with brown eyes and a yellow bikini, while Casey is blonde with brown eyes (because she is using Francie's face), in a bikini which is found in varying shades of red, rose, and hot pink.
Becky (2009): In 1971, as Casey ended production, Mattel intended to introduce a Francie-sized doll to replace her. This doll was named Becky. She appears (apparently, a prototype) in Mattel's 1971 fashion booklets that came with Mattel's Barbie doll fashions, alongside her friend Francie. She's presented using the Casey face mold, but with brown eyes and an ash blonde flip with a headband. Some of Francie's fashions that year even list "Francie and Becky" on the boxes. However, for undetermined reasons, Becky never entered production. In 2009, Mattel finally produced a version of this near-mythical doll, in a boxed set titled Most Mod Becky. She was produced as she appeared in Mattel's 1971 fashion booklets, with three different outfits, and party accessories (such as invitations, records, record player, and telephone).


=== Jazzie's friends ===
Dude (boyfriend – 1989): This doll was made from the 1986 Barbie and the Rockers Derek face sculpt.
Chelsie (1989): This doll was made from the 1979 Starr friend Tracey face sculpt.
Stacie (1989): This doll was made from the 1972 Steffie face sculpt and was African American character.


== Friends of friends ==


=== Ken's family and friends ===
Allan (1964–1965, 1991, 2002): This character has been revived several times. Allan started out as "Ken's Buddy" and was paired with the Midge doll from the beginning. In 1991, a line of dolls was created depicting a wedding for Allan and Midge. Later, a family-themed line of dolls, much like the earlier Heart Family, had the two characters raising a family.
Brad (1970): This African American male doll was available in two versions: Talking Brad and Brad with Bendable Legs. He was made from an all-new face sculpt that is known as the Brad face sculpt. The Brad character was introduced as a boyfriend for the Christie character.
Curtis (1975): This African American male character is virtually identical to Brad, and was available as only one version, 1975 Free Moving Curtis. Curtis was the boyfriend of the Free Moving Cara doll.
Todd (1983): This doll was only available as a groom character, paired with the Tracy character from the same year. This Todd doll used the 1978 Super Star Ken face sculpt.
Steven (boyfriend of Christie, 1988–present. Linked with Barbie's friend Nikki since 2007): This doll has been in the lineup intermittently over the years and has used several different face sculpts during that time.
Tommy (1997): Ken's little brother.
Derek (1985): He was never advertised as a friend of Ken's but was a member of Barbie and the Rockers along with Ken and the four female band members listed above.
Kurt (2005): He was a Fashion Fever friend of Barbie. He was first male doll in this line and was made with the Tango Ken/Blaine face sculpt.
Ryan (2012–2015): He is Raquelle's twin brother and Ken's rival. He is a main character in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series. Ryan has a crush on Barbie, and therefore competes with Ken for her affection.

In the film, Barbie crosses paths with her over a locker engraved in their name in a performing arts school in Brooklyn, New York City. They become fast friends and have been sharing spotlights and lead roles in most recent entries in the media franchise. Christopher Keenan, who served as co-executive producer and co-writer of the 2021 film described her as a "fearless, smart and loyal friend with an exuberant and infectious personality" as well as being "a confident and optimistic triple-threat singer, dancer and musician who dreams big and believes in the limitless possibilities of life".


=== Model of the Moment ===
A collector series of dolls designed by veteran Mattel designer Robert Best. The series featured three new characters including Daria, Marisa, and Nichelle. The dolls were notable for featuring a new body sculpt known as Model Muse, which is a body designed to stay in one static pose as a display figurine. The series was discontinued after only 5 dolls, but the dolls live on as their face and body sculpts are used for other Barbie dolls ever since. The Model Muse body in particular has become the new standard body for collector dolls in the Barbie line.

Daria (2004-2005) was the Caucasian doll in this collection. Two versions of her were released, including Daria Celebutante and Daria Shopping Queen.
Marisa (2004-2005) was the Hispanic doll in this collection. Two versions of her were released, including Pretty Young Thing Marisa and Beach Baby Marisa.
Nichelle (2004) was the African-American doll in this collection, not to be confused with the Shani character Nichelle. Only one version was released, Nichelle Urban Hipster.

Nichelle (1991–1994)

=== Asha - African American Collection ===
