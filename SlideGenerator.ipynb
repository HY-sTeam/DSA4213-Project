      "============================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. It is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The solutions to these subproblems are then combined to find the optimal solution to the original problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slide 2: Matrix Chain Multiplication\n",
      "===================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Matrix chain multiplication (or the matrix chain ordering problem) is an optimization problem concerning the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by calculating the optimal order of multiplications for each possible partition of the matrix chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slide 3: Stochastic Dynamic Programming\n",
      "======================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally introduced by Richard E. Bellman in (Bellman 1957), stochastic dynamic programming is a technique for modelling and solving problems of decision making under uncertainty. It is used to find the optimal policy for a sequence of decisions, where the outcome of each decision is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slide 4: Conclusion\n",
      "==================\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic programming is a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems. By breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and combining their solutions, dynamic programming allows us to find the optimal solution to even the most difficult problems.\n"
